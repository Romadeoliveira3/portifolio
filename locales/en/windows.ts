    title: 'About Me',
    content: `Hello! I'm Romário Jonas (or Roma), a Bachelor's student in Electronic Engineering and a Mid-level Full‑stack Developer with solid experience in data analysis, automation, and software architecture. I work on building scalable and efficient solutions that bring together technology, sustainability, and innovation.

My path includes experience at Ford Motor Company, SEMINE, and FITec. I have applied technologies such as FastAPI, NestJS, PostgreSQL, Docker, RabbitMQ, Prisma, and Prometheus/Grafana to develop distributed systems and microservice‑based platforms.

My philosophy is to build robust and well‑structured solutions with a focus on clarity, performance, and real‑world impact. I believe in the union of data science and software engineering to transform information into intelligent and sustainable decisions.

This portfolio reflects my technical and creative journey — a space where technology and purpose meet. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out!`,
